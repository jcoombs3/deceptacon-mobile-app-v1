  <p>Decepta Con is a safe space where everyone is welcome and may express themselves freely. Even so, certain kinds of offensive or harassing behavior will not be tolerated. We have taken steps to make it easy to report instances of such behavior. It’s very important that if you are being harassed or endangered, you report it immediately. We cannot address anything that we aren’t made aware of and need whatever detail can be provided, such as names, badge numbers, or other descriptive information. As a member, if you see someone harassed or taking inappropriate photos (where the target of the photo is unaware), we encourage you to speak up and say something. Look out for one another and ensure we are all treated with respect.</p>

  <p>If you feel you’ve been harassed please find the nearest volunteer. They will direct you to security. If, at any time, you feel that your safety or the safety of others is in jeopardy, please contact Emergency Services via 911.</p>

  <p>Decepta Con reserves the right to revoke passes without refund or compensation (Rule 13). If an individual breaks the rules of the convention, they may be barred, either for several hours or for the rest of the event. If an individual breaks the law (city, state, or federal) they will be arrested. If you have been punished for breaking a rule and feel that you’ve been treated unfairly you may appeal that ruling with the convention organizers, but that decision will be final.</p>
